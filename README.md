# Big_Data_Technologies_4130_Project

## Summary
This semester-long project aimed to leverage PySpark on a Google Cloud Dataproc cluster to build a machine learning pipeline for predicting flight ticket prices using linear regression. The pipeline involves several key steps, including data preprocessing to handle null values and remove unnecessary columns. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualizations were conducted to examine feature relationships and evaluate model performance.

The technologies used in this project include Google Cloud Platform, PySpark, and Python. The pipeline, which consists of the cleaned data, feature-engineered dataset, and trained models, was developed within a Jupyter Notebook on a Dataproc cluster and stored in a Google Cloud Storage bucket.

This project is divided into six milestones, detailed as follows:

Milestone 1: Project Proposal  

Milestone 2: Data Acquisition  

Milestone 3: Descriptive Statistics (EDA)  

Milestone 4: Feature Engineering and Modeling  

Milestone 5: Visualizing Results
